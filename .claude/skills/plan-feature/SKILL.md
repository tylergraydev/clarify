description: Generate detailed implementation plans through automated 3-4 step orchestration with optional clarification
---

You are a streamlined feature planning orchestrator that creates detailed implementation plans through a 3-4 step process with optional clarification.

@CLAUDE.MD

## Command Usage

```
/plan-feature "feature description"
```

**Examples:**

- `/plan-feature "Add user authentication with OAuth"`
- `/plan-feature "Implement real-time notifications system"`
- `/plan-feature "Create admin dashboard with analytics"`

## Workflow Overview

When the user runs this command, execute this workflow:

1. **Clarification** (Optional): Gather clarifying questions if request is ambiguous
2. **Feature Request Refinement**: Enhance the user request with project context
3. **File Discovery**: Find all relevant files for the implementation
4. **Implementation Planning**: Generate detailed Markdown implementation plan with quality gates

### Clarification Skip Conditions

The clarification step is automatically skipped when:

- Clarification agent determines request is sufficiently detailed (ambiguity score >= 4/5)
- Request explicitly references specific files, components, or patterns
- Request includes clear technical implementation details

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Step 0a: Feature Request Clarification (Conditional)

**Objective**: Gather clarifying information for ambiguous or underspecified feature requests before refinement.

**Process**:

1. Record step start time with ISO timestamp
2. Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "clarification-agent"`:
   - Description: "Assess feature request clarity and generate targeted clarification questions"
   - Pass: Original feature request from `$ARGUMENTS`
   - **TIMEOUT**: Set 60-second timeout for exploration + question generation
   - Agent performs light codebase exploration (reads CLAUDE.md, scans key directories)
   - Agent assesses request ambiguity on a 1-5 scale
   - If score >= 4: Agent returns `SKIP_CLARIFICATION` marker with reasoning
   - If score < 4: Agent returns `QUESTIONS_FOR_USER` section with structured JSON questions

3. **Conditional Branch**:

   **IF `SKIP_CLARIFICATION` returned:**
   - Log skip decision with reasoning
   - Set `$ENHANCED_REQUEST` = `$ARGUMENTS` (original request unchanged)
   - Save minimal `00a-clarification.md` noting skip decision
   - Proceed directly to Step 1

   **IF `QUESTIONS_FOR_USER` returned:**
   - Parse the JSON questions array from the agent's response
   - Use **AskUserQuestion** tool directly with the parsed questions
   - Collect user responses
   - Build enhanced request from original + user answers
   - Set `$ENHANCED_REQUEST` = formatted enhanced request
   - Save detailed `00a-clarification.md` with full Q&A

4. **Build Enhanced Request** (when clarification gathered):
   After receiving user answers via AskUserQuestion, format the enhanced request as:

   ```
   [Original request]

   Additional context from clarification:
   - [Question 1]: [User's answer]
   - [Question 2]: [User's answer]
   ```

5. Record step end time and results

6. **SAVE STEP 0a LOG**: Create `docs/{YYYY_MM_DD}/orchestration/{feature-name}/00a-clarification.md` with:
   - Step metadata (timestamps, duration, status: Completed/Skipped)
   - Original request
   - Codebase exploration summary (what was examined)
   - Ambiguity assessment score and reasoning
   - Questions generated (if any)
   - User responses (if any)
   - Skip decision and reason (if applicable)
   - Final enhanced request passed to Step 1

7. **CHECKPOINT**: Step 0a markdown log now available for review

8. **Progress Marker**: Output `MILESTONE:STEP_0A_COMPLETE` or `MILESTONE:STEP_0A_SKIPPED`

### Step 1: Feature Request Refinement

**Objective**: Enhance the user's request with project context to make it more actionable.

**Process**:

1. **Initialize Orchestration Directory**: Create `docs/{YYYY_MM_DD}/orchestration/{feature-name}/` directory structure
2. **Create Orchestration Index**: Save `docs/{YYYY_MM_DD}/orchestration/{feature-name}/00-orchestration-index.md` with workflow overview and links
3. Record step start time with ISO timestamp
4. Read CLAUDE.md and package.json for project context
5. Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`:
   - Description: "Refine feature request with project context"
   - **IMPORTANT**: Request single paragraph output (200-500 words) without headers or sections
   - **ERROR HANDLING**: If subagent fails, retry once with simplified prompt and log the failure
   - **TIMEOUT**: Set 30-second timeout for subagent response
   - **RETRY STRATEGY**: Maximum 2 attempts with exponential backoff
   - Prompt template: "Refine this feature request into a SINGLE PARAGRAPH (no headers, bullet points, or sections): '$ENHANCED_REQUEST'. Using the project context from CLAUDE.md and package.json dependencies, expand this request with relevant technical details while maintaining its core intent. If clarification context is provided, incorporate those decisions into your refinement. Output ONLY the refined paragraph (200-500 words), nothing else."
   - **NOTE**: `$ENHANCED_REQUEST` comes from Step 0a - either the original request (if clarification was skipped) or the original request plus clarification context (if questions were answered)
   - **CONSTRAINT**: Output must be single paragraph format only
   - **CONSTRAINT**: Refined request must be 2-4x original length (no excessive expansion)
   - **CONSTRAINT**: Preserve original intent and scope (no feature creep)
   - **CONSTRAINT**: Add only essential technical context, not exhaustive details
   - **LOG REQUIREMENT**: Capture complete agent prompt and full response
   - **FALLBACK**: If subagent returns invalid format, extract paragraph content manually
   - Agent returns enhanced feature request as single paragraph
6. Record step end time and validate output
   - **Format Check**: Verify output is single paragraph (no headers, sections, or bullet points)
   - **Length Check**: Verify refined request is 200-500 words and 2-4x original length
   - **Scope Check**: Confirm core intent preserved without feature creep
   - **Quality Check**: Ensure only essential technical context added
   - **Error Recovery**: If format is wrong, extract just the paragraph content if possible
   - **Validation Success**: Log successful validation or detailed error messages
7. **SAVE STEP 1 LOG**: Create `docs/{YYYY_MM_DD}/orchestration/{feature-name}/01-feature-refinement.md` with:
   - Step metadata (timestamps, duration, status)
   - Original request and context provided
   - Clarification context (if gathered in Step 0a)
   - Complete agent prompt sent
   - Full agent response received
   - Refined feature request extracted
   - **Length Analysis**: Original vs refined word count comparison
   - **Scope Analysis**: Assessment of intent preservation
   - Validation results and any warnings
8. **CHECKPOINT**: Step 1 markdown log now available for review/debugging
9. **Progress Marker**: Output `MILESTONE:STEP_1_COMPLETE`

### Step 2: AI-Powered File Discovery

**Objective**: Use the file discovery agent to intelligently identify all files
relevant to implementing the feature by analyzing the refined request and codebase structure.

**Process**:

1. Record step start time with ISO timestamp
2. Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "file-discovery-agent"`:
3. **AI-Powered Discovery**: Use integrated Claude API for intelligent file analysis:
   - **Context-Aware Analysis**: AI examines the refined feature request and understands implementation requirements
   - **Codebase Structure Analysis**: AI analyzes the the target project architecture and patterns
   - **Content-Based Discovery**: AI reads and analyzes file contents for relevance (not just filenames)
   - **Smart Prioritization**: AI categorizes files by implementation priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - **Comprehensive Coverage**: AI searches across all architectural layers (schemas, actions, queries, validations, components, pages)
   - **Pattern Recognition**: AI identifies existing similar functionality and integration points
   - **ERROR HANDLING**: If AI analysis fails, retry with simplified prompt and log the failure
   - **TIMEOUT**: Set 60-second timeout for AI file discovery
   - **RETRY STRATEGY**: Maximum 2 attempts with fallback strategies
   - **MINIMUM REQUIREMENT**: Must discover at least 3 relevant files through AI analysis
   - **LOG REQUIREMENT**: Capture complete AI prompt and full analysis response
4. **Enhanced File Validation**:
   - Validate all AI-discovered file paths exist using file system checks
   - Check file permissions and accessibility
   - Log any missing or inaccessible files discovered by AI
   - Flag files that may need creation vs modification
   - Cross-reference AI analysis with actual file contents
5. Record step end time and validation results
6. **SAVE STEP 2 LOG**: Create `docs/{YYYY_MM_DD}/orchestration/{feature-name}/02-file-discovery.md` with:
   - Step metadata (timestamps, duration, status)
   - Refined request used as input
   - Complete AI prompt sent and analysis received
   - AI file discovery analysis with reasoning
   - Discovered files list with AI-generated categorization and priorities
   - File path validation results and existence checks
   - AI analysis metrics (API cost, duration, tokens used)
   - Discovery statistics and coverage analysis
7. **UPDATE INDEX**: Append Step 2 summary to orchestration index
8. **CHECKPOINT**: Step 2 markdown log now available for review/debugging
9. **Progress Marker**: Output `MILESTONE:STEP_2_COMPLETE`

### Step 3: Implementation Planning

**Objective**: Generate detailed markdown implementation plan following the required template, with quality gates at logical checkpoints.

**Process**:

1. Record step start time with ISO timestamp
2. Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "implementation-planner"`:
   - Description: "Generate detailed implementation plan"
   - **CRITICAL**: Explicitly request MARKDOWN format following the agent's template
   - **ERROR HANDLING**: If XML format returned, attempt automatic conversion to markdown and log the issue
   - **TIMEOUT**: Set 60-second timeout for plan generation
   - **RETRY STRATEGY**: If format validation fails, retry with explicit format constraints (maximum 2 attempts)
   - **FALLBACK**: If all retries fail, flag for manual review and continue with available output
   - Prompt must include: "Generate an implementation plan in MARKDOWN format (NOT XML) following your defined template with these sections: ## Overview (with Estimated Duration, Complexity, Risk Level), ## Quick Summary, ## Prerequisites, ## Implementation Steps (each step with What/Why/Confidence/Files/Changes/Validation Commands/Success Criteria), ## Quality Gates, ## Notes. IMPORTANT: Include 'pnpm run lint:fix && pnpm run typecheck' validation for every step touching JS/JSX/TS/TSX files. Do NOT include code examples.
   - Pass refined feature request, discovered files analysis, and project context
   - **LOG REQUIREMENT**: Capture complete agent prompt and full response
   - **VALIDATION COMMANDS**: Ensure all steps include appropriate validation commands
   - Agent generates structured markdown implementation plan
3. **Enhanced Plan Validation**:
   - **Format Check**: Verify output is markdown with required sections (not XML)
   - **Auto-Conversion**: If XML format detected, attempt automatic conversion to markdown
   - **Template Compliance**: Check for Overview, Prerequisites, Implementation Steps, Quality Gates
   - **Section Validation**: Verify each required section contains appropriate content
   - **Command Validation**: Ensure steps include `pnpm run lint:fix && pnpm run typecheck`
   - **Content Quality**: Verify no code examples or implementations included
   - **Completeness Check**: Confirm plan addresses all aspects of the refined request
   - **Error Recovery**: If validation fails, retry with explicit format constraints
   - **Manual Review Flag**: If auto-conversion fails, flag for manual review
4. Record step end time and validation results
5. **SAVE STEP 3 LOG**: Create `docs/{YYYY_MM_DD}/orchestration/{feature-name}/03-implementation-planning.md` with:
   - Step metadata (timestamps, duration, status)
   - Refined request and file analysis used as input
   - Complete agent prompt sent
   - Full agent response with implementation plan
   - Plan format validation results (markdown vs XML check)
   - Template compliance validation results
   - Complexity assessment and time estimates
   - Quality gate results
6. **UPDATE INDEX**: Append Step 3 summary to orchestration index
7. **FINAL CHECKPOINT**: All step logs now available for review
8. **SAVE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**: Create separate `docs/{YYYY_MM_DD}/plans/{feature-name}-implementation-plan.md` file
   - Ensure plan is saved in proper markdown format
   - If agent returned XML, convert to markdown or flag for manual review
9. **Progress Markers**: Output `MILESTONE:STEP_3_COMPLETE` then `MILESTONE:PLAN_FEATURE_SUCCESS`
