# Workflow Page Shell - Orchestration Index

Generated: 2026-02-05
Feature: Workflow Page Layout and Shell Implementation

## Workflow Overview

Plan the implementation of the workflow page layout and shell at `/workflows/[id]`. This covers the full UI structure with placeholder data and functions - no real functionality. The goal is to complete the visual shell before adding real workflow step logic.

## Steps

- [00a - Clarification](./00a-clarification.md)
- [01 - Feature Refinement](./01-feature-refinement.md)
- [02 - File Discovery](./02-file-discovery.md)
- [03 - Implementation Planning](./03-implementation-planning.md)

## Status

- Step 0a: Skipped (ambiguity score 5/5 - request well-specified)
- Step 1: Completed (refined request with project context, ~430 words)
- Step 2: Completed (discovered 40+ files: 10 create, 4 modify, 26+ reference)
- Step 3: Completed (15-step implementation plan, 3-4 day estimate)
