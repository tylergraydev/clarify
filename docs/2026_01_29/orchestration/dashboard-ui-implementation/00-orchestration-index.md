## Original Request

```
1. Dashboard UI Implementation (Recommended)

Why: The dashboard is the entry point for users. With all data layer and IPC infrastructure
complete, the dashboard is the natural first UI to build. It provides immediate visibility
into the app's value and connects all other features.

Scope:
- Active workflows summary widget (uses existing useWorkflows hook with status filter)
- Recent workflows list (uses existing useWorkflows hook)
- Quick actions card (New Workflow, New Project buttons)
- Statistics overview (project count, workflow completion rate)

Unblocks: Gives users a landing page and demonstrates the app works before diving into
complex workflow execution UI.
