```
2. Workflow History Page Implementation

Why: The /workflows/history page is also a placeholder. This complements the active
workflows page to provide the complete workflow management experience. Query infrastructure
exists with status filtering capability.

Scope: Filter workflows by completed/failed/cancelled statuses, add date range filtering,
display completion metrics

Unblocks: Audit trail navigation; users can review past workflows without navigating
through projects.
